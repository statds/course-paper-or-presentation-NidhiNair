Title IX Compliance and Equity in Athletics

June 23rd, 2022 marked the 50th anniversary of Title IX laws, the historic federal civil rights law that has been credited with profoundly changing education by gender in the United States. Title IX compliance in college-level athletics is a contentious issue as budget cuts due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021 forced universities to reevaluate their allotments to club sports helmed by female players. One of the ways compliance is measured in universities is by showing that the school is fully and effectively meeting its students' interests and abilities to participate in sports. This paper aims to study compliance through that measure in all eleven Big East schools using the EADA and IPEDS datasets, and by conducting a paired T-test and Hotelling's T-Squared test to analyze athletic expenditure by gender and undergraduate enrollment.
